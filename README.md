# hello-world
This is my first repository (containing files and anything a project would need). I created it on February 19th, 2016.

My name is Bev. I'm a freshman Biomedical engineering major, and I began programming in September of 2015. I am currently a beginner in MATLAB. I've created this repository and this branch as part of my first hackathon experience.
